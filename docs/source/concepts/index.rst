Concepts
!!!!!!!!

VRS is a collection of data models or concepts that are used together to represent molecular 
and systemic variation. An inhertiance view is available in the :ref:`ClassDiagram` appendix.
These models exist across several related domains:

- :ref:`MolecularVariation`: models that describe variation on a contiguous molecule
- :ref:`SystemicVariation`: models that describe variation in a system
- :ref:`SequenceLocation`: a model that describes a location on a molecule sequence
- :ref:`SequenceExpression`: models that describe a molecule sequence
- :ref:`AdditionalDataTypes`: additional data types that support the above models
