VRS currently covers many classes of variation that are defined on a contiguous molecule such as single nucleotide 
variants (SNVs), multi-nucleotide variants (MNVs), indels, repeats, haplotypes, breakpoints, and sequence 
rearrangments that form derivative molecules. 

Collectively, these types of variation are called molecular variation.
